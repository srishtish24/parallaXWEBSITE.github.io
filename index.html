    <h2>What Is Needed For Vlogging?</h2>
     <p>   Creators can start vlogging with just a cell phone, however, most vloggers rely on equipment such as a quality vlogging camera, a tripod, a microphone and muffler, a laptop and editing software.
        
        The ceiling on how much equipment you could use to vlog is extremely high. Most people recommend starting with the bare minimum and gradually purchasing equipment as your audience grows. 
     More advanced vloggers also use equipment such as tripods, drones, go-pros, and lightboxes to get the best footage for each video.
